Use your template styling to create a semi-transparent teaser overlay.

== Description ==

Opaque Teaser creates a translucent overlay over your current theme to show off your work while blocking the nitty gritty details from your visitors. It will show up only for logged-out users, allowing you to keep editing and working on your website

The plugin is simple to configure and uses your existing theme styling. It’s only a few clicks before your site is locked down with a beautiful alternative to the normal landing page.


== Installation ==

1. Upload `Opaque Teaser` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Activate the teaser and configure the settings on the plugin settings page
4. You now have a teaser overlay


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use my site while the teaser is active? =

Yes, if you are logged in.

The plugin only displays the teaser for those who aren’t logged in. It also doesn’t block your login form, so you still have full access.

= Can I use short codes in the custom HTML box? =

Yes!

The custom HTML is wrapped in do_shortcode() so you can run any short codes that you please in the custom box.

= I deactivated the teaser and it’s not going away? =

More than likely you have caching installed - delete the cache from your caching plugin setting page and it should clear up just fine.
